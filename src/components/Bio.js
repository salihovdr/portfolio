			<p>In my other life, I worked at a U.S. Embassy and told America's story to a small ex-Soviet country bordering Afganistan. I also helped launch a food delivery start-up and supported organizations that helped kids from underprivileged families to stay away from street crime. I have a graduate degree in business and speak four languages. When I'm not coding, I hang out with family and friends, play sports or go out for long walks.</p>
